# NeRF Project

This repository contains the implementation of a **Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)** model for 3D scene reconstruction and 3D mesh extraction. The project includes functionalities for training a NeRF model, rendering novel views, and exporting 3D meshes.

Most Finalized items are in the `Final/` folder. It is important to note that most of our project was aimed to understand and replicate NeRFs and we do not claim to have reinvented any of it!
